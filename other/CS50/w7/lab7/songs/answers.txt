1: I would say Purple and Orange could work as the "user's" Aura as the top 100 are quite energetic and danceable.
2: I think putting a weight into each song (according to it's position on the top 100) to calculate the averages would work better as the more you listen to a song, the more it will weight on your values. It's not representative to claim the same weight for your MOST listened song and for your 100th most listened song.
