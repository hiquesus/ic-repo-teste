                &nbsp; Some of my hobbies:

                &#9679; &nbsp; &gt; Olympiads ðŸ“š &lt;

                I Really enjoy doing olympiads.
                Mostly because I am able to learn DURING the exam.
                Be it an Astronomy Olympiad or a Mathematical one,
                I'll still be able to learn new things during the exam.
                And that's why I love doing them!

                &#9679; &nbsp; &gt; Music ðŸŽ¶ &lt;

                Music has always been a part of my life.
                However, recently I've been geting into all sorts of music;
                new music! not just whatever I was used to, but new genres I have to explore!

                &#9679; &nbsp; &gt; Programming ðŸ’» &lt;

                Even though I didn't have much time to learn these past few months,
                I still love to learn things about coding.
                It's amazing to be able to understand how this mess we call The Internet works.
                I hope I can further learn more about it whenever I'm done with High School.
                (Later this year)

                &#9679; &nbsp; &gt; Gaming ðŸŽ® &lt;

                I play games quite regularly, it's one of my favourite art mediums.
                Being immersed in those worlds is quite magical...
                Especially if I'm in Virtual Reality.

                &#9679; &nbsp; &gt; Video Editing/Cinematography ðŸŽ¬ &lt;

                When the pandemic started I felt quite lost,
                but and somehow I found myself in video editing...
                Editing anything was fun, be it video games, or even a short movie.

                Here is one short film me and my friends made for a school project last year:
                (It's in Portuguese of course!)
