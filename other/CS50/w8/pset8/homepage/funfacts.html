                &nbsp; Some fun (or maybe not so fun) facts about me:

                &#9679; &nbsp; I met CÃ©sar Camacho, director of The FGV EMAp - School of Applied Mathematics
                (He also was the one who led the creation of OBMEP
                -The Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad of Public Schools-,
                which is the largest school competition in the whole world!)

                &#9679; &nbsp; Though living in Brazil my entire life, I am learning multiple languages, incluiding:
                (hover mouse over language)
                <div class="dropdown">
                    - English -
                    <div class="dropdown-content">
                        which I have been learning ever since I was a little kid,
                        be it through video games, youtube videos, movies, or actual english classes!
                        &nbsp;
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="dropdown">
                    - Spanish -
                    <div class="dropdown-content">
                        a similar language to Portuguese, therefore picking it up was not very hard
                        for me, as I could pass by a Spanish speaker by talking in Portuguese with a
                        not so good Spanish accent (changing some words of course).
                        &nbsp;
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="dropdown">
                    - Swedish -
                    <div class="dropdown-content">
                        I have been learning Swedish for about two years and though I don't have
                        a lot of time to study, it feels great to do so whenever I find some spare time!
                        &nbsp;
                    </div>
                </div>



                &#9679; &nbsp; I used to play Handball, and I wasn't bad at it, I was even invited to be in
                our school's team, but I just played it for fun so I only went to the classes. But I stopped
                after the pandemic had begun. I still enjoy playing sports though. For fun. Not competitively.

                &#9679; &nbsp; I don't really know what other fun facts there are about me, can't think of anything
                so I'll just leave the fact that I was once bitten by a dog here!
