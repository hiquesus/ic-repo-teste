Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

As the number of simulations increased, the results appeared to be more precise when comparing
the chances of a team with it's rating.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would consider 100,000 (one hundred thousand) to be enough as it's result is really similar to 1,000,000's,
which is not worth when you can see the huge jump in time when both are run. (almost 10x slower than 100,000's).
However 10,000 could also be a great option if you are short on time (or money when considering the fee)
